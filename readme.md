#BlackJack 
##A Single Page Console Application

### Demo
<http://jaredsavage.com/projects/blackjack/>

### Notes
1. Written in ES5
2. I didn't use any external code unless otherwise noted. No jQuery, no Require.js. For some things I refered to SO, but did not copy or paste any code. Everything is my own implementation written from scratch for this exercise, except where otherwise noted. Graphics are heavily modified from resources found online.
3. Graphics use elements found online, heavily modified for this exercise.

### Known issues
1. When you run out of cards (there are 6 decks in play), there isn't a mechanism to reshuffle the cards.
2. The CSS uses important for the stylish console overrides. Would like to clean this up to have a better defined skinning mechanism.
