#BlackJack 
##A Single Page Console Application

### Demo
<http://jaredsavage.com/projects/blackjack/>

### Notes
1. Written in ES5
2. No external code unless otherwise noted. Everything is my own implementation written from scratch for this exercise, except where otherwise noted.
3. Graphics are heavily modified from resources found online.

### Known issues
1. When you run out of cards (there are 6 decks in play), there isn't a mechanism to reshuffle the cards.
2. The CSS uses important for the stylish console overrides. Would like to clean this up to have a better defined skinning mechanism.
3. Player class isn't implemented, currently part of blackjack.js
